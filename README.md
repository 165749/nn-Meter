nn-Meter is a novel and efficient system to accurately predict the inference latency of DNN models on diverse edge devices. The key idea is dividing a whole model inference into kernels, i.e., the execution units of fused operators on a device, and conduct kernel-level prediction. We currently evaluate four popular platforms on a large dataset of 26k models. It achieves 99.0% (mobile CPU), 99.1% (mobile Adreno 640 GPU), 99.0% (mobile Adreno 630 GPU), and 83.4% (Intel VPU) prediction accuracy.

The current supported hardware and inference frameworks:

## Who should consider using nn-Meter

- Those who want to get the DNN inference latency on mobile and edge devices with **no deployment efforts on real devices**.
- Those who want to run **hardware-aware NAS with [NNI](https://github.com/microsoft/nni)**.
- Those who want to **build latency predictors for their own devices**.

# Installation

To install nn-meter, please first install python3. The test environment uses anaconda python 3.6.10. Install the dependencies via:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
Please also check the versions of numpy, scikit_learn. The different versions may change the prediction accuracy of kernel predictors.

If you use nn-meter in NNI, make sure NNI version >= 2.4

# Usage
## Supported input model format
We have two types of interfacesï¼š
- command line `nn-meter` after install the package `nn-meter`
- Python binding provided by the module `nn_meter`

Here is a summary of supported inputs of the two methods.

|       Name        |                     Command Support                 | Python Binding |
| :--------------:  | :-------------------------------------------------: | :---: |
|    Tensorflow     |  Checkpoint file dumped by `tf.saved_model()` and endwith `.pb`  | Checkpoint file dumped by `tf.saved_model` and endwith `.pb` | 
|       Torch       | Models in `torchvision.models` | Object of `torch.nn.Module` |
|       Onnx        | Checkpoint file dumped by `onnx.save()` and endwith `.onnx`  | Checkpoint file dumped by `onnx.save()` or model loaded by `onnx.load()` |
| nn-Meter IR graph | Json file in the format of [nn-Meter IR Graph](./docs/input_models.md#nnmeter-ir-graph)  | `dict` object following the format of [nn-Meter IR Graph](./docs/input_models.md#nnmeter-ir-graph) | 
|   NNI IR graph    | -  | `dict` object following [NNI Doc](https://nni.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Tutorial/InstallationLinux.html#installation) |


## Command line Support
### List all predefined predictors

After installation, a command named `nn-meter` is enabled. Users can get all predefined predictors by running

```bash
# to list all predefined predictors
nn-meter --list-predictors 
```

nn-Meter currently supports prediction on the following four config:

| Predictor (device_inferenceframework) |
| :-----------------------------------: |
|         cortexA76cpu_tflite21         |
|         adreno640gpu_tflite21         |
|         adreno630gpu_tflite21         |
|       myriadvpu_openvino2019r2        |

For the input model file, you can find any example provided under the `data/testmodels`


### Predict latency for CNN model

To predict the latency for a CNN model with a predefined predictor in command line, users can run the following commands

```bash
# for Tensorflow (*.pb) file
nn-meter --predictor <hardware> [--predictor-version <version>] --tensorflow <pb-file_or_folder> 

# for ONNX (*.onnx) file
nn-meter --predictor <hardware> [--predictor-version <version>] --onnx <onnx-file_or_folder>

# for torch model from torchvision model zoo (str)
nn-meter --predictor <hardware> [--predictor-version <version>] --torchvision <model-name> <model-name>... 

# for nn-Meter IR (*.json) file
nn-meter --predictor <hardware> [--predictor-version <version>] --nn-meter-ir <json-file_or_folder> 
```

`--predictor-version <version>` arguments is optional. When the predictor version is not specified by users, nn-meter will use the latest verison of the predictor.

nn-Meter can support batch mode prediction. To predict latency for multiple models in the same model type once, user should collect all models in one folder and state the folder after `--[model-type]` liked argument.

 It should also be noted that for PyTorch model, nn-meter can only support existing models in torchvision model zoo. The string followed by `--torchvision` should be exactly one or more string indicating name(s) of some existing torchvision models.


### Convert to nn-Meter IR Graph

Furthermore, users may be interested to convert tensorflow pb-file or onnx file to nn-Meter IR graph. Users could convert nn-Meter IR graph and save to `.json` file be running

```bash
# for Tensorflow (*.pb) file
nn-meter getir --tensorflow <pb-file> [--output <output-name>]

# for ONNX (*.onnx) file
nn-meter getir --onnx <onnx-file> [--output <output-name>]
```

Output name is default to be `/path/to/input/file/<input_file_name>_<model-type>_ir.json` if not specified by users.


## Import nn-Meter in your python code: Python binding

After installation, users can import nn-Meter in python code

```python
from nn_meter import load_latency_predictor

predictor = load_latency_predictor(hardware_name, hardware_predictor_version) # case insensitive in backend

# build your model here
model = ... # model is instance of torch.nn.Module

lat = predictor.predict(model)
```

By calling `load_latency_predictor`, user selects the target hardware (`Framework-Hardware`) and loads the corresponding predictor. nn-Meter will try to find the right predictor file in `~/.nn_meter/data`. If the predictor file doesn't exist, it will download from the Github release.

Users could view the information all built-in predictors by `list_latency_predictors` or view the config file in `nn_meter/configs/predictors.yaml`.

Users could get a nn-Meter IR graph by applying `model_file_to_graph` and `model_to_graph` by calling the model name or model object and specify the model type. The supporting model types of `model_file_to_graph` include "onnx", "pb", "torch", "nnmeter-ir" and "nni-ir", while the supporting model types of `model_to_graph` include "onnx", "torch", "nnmeter-ir" and "nni-ir".

## Hardware-aware NAS by nn-Meter and NNI

### Run multi-trial SPOS demo

Install NNI by following [NNI Doc](https://nni.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Tutorial/InstallationLinux.html#installation).

Install nn-Meter from source code (currently we haven't released this package, so development installation is required).

```bash
python setup.py develop
```

Then run multi-trail SPOS demo:

```bash
python ${NNI_ROOT}/examples/nas/oneshot/spos/multi_trial.py
```

### How the demo works

Refer to [nni doc](https://nni.readthedocs.io/en/stable/nas.html) for how to perform NAS by NNI.

To support latency-aware NAS, you first need a `Strategy` that supports filtering the models by latency. We provide such a filter named `LatencyFilter` in NNI and initialize a `Random` strategy with the filter:

```python
simple_strategy = strategy.Random(model_filter=LatencyFilter(100)
```

`LatencyFilter` will predict the models' latency by using nn-Meter and filter out the models whose latency are larger than the threshold (i.e., `100` in this example).
You can also build your own strategies and filters to support more flexible NAS such as sorting the models according to latency.

Then, pass this strategy to `RetiariiExperiment` along with some additional arguments: `parse_shape=True, example_inputs=example_inputs`:

```python
RetiariiExperiment(base_model, trainer, [], simple_strategy, True, example_inputs)
```

Here, `parse_shape=True` means extracting shape info from the torch model as it is required by nn-Meter to predict latency. `example_inputs` is required for tracing shape info.
